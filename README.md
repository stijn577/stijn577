### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at UGent studying Electrical engineering. I mostly do embedded stuff where I design a PCB and write the software for the board. Most of the time I write the firmware using C, C++ or Rust. But I sometimes use other prebuilt frameworks like QMK for keyboard design. Below you can find some images of my projects:

1. Keyboard

2. TODO app rust stack, running in a docker container, this is just during the tech stack setup
